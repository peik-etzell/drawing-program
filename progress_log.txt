- Added Operation.scala, which handles mouse clicks and moves depending on the mode that is selected,
for example creating rectangles or moving elements etc.

- Planning to simplify and use GUI.scala as main object, and remove Program.scala
- Also in GUI, added UIManager style handling
- Made more dropdown menus for the menubar, while commenting out the buttonpanel from before,
but still probably using it later on

- Canvas is essentially a buffer now, that calls each elements draw method, has undo/redo handling

- Element is very much work in progress, with only drawing of basic rectangles and lines possible.
- Operation.scala also has a Preferences object with the current settings of operations, such as color of new elements and if shapes should be filled etc.

- Filemanager has no work done yet


Right now the drawing has gotten more laggy, so I am planning to implement memoization for the Element class,
and maybe multithreading also.
No Unittesting has been done yet, only testing by hand, but that would be good to get going when more operations get implemented, 
like rotations and such.
So far maybe 20 hours of work have been put into this, feeling like it is progressing pretty good, ahead of schedule.
